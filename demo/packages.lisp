;;; always being created at compile time (the defpackage is processed
;;; regardless of whether this is ics or not). At load time either
;;; the package is created (ics) or an alias to clim-graphics-editor
;;; is added (non-ics). The unless deals with the situation of
;;; compiling and then loading in the same non-ICS image! (cim 2/28/96)
