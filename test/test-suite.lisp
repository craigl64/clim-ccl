#|
To do:

Benchmarks of how long it takes to bring up an application frame.
AND and OR types?  SEQUENCE?  What others?
More correct search for the sensitive presentation (Move command on NOR gate).
Non-unique unique-ids in redisplay.
DRAGGING-OUTPUT should replay the records that get clobbered as you drag.
Dialog-style input of partial commands.
Mixed-mode commands that contains "unreadable" objects in them.
See if to-command translators work when the command has no command-line name.
Presentation histories and kill rings?
c-? in completion when there are no completions.
MENU-CHOOSE when there are no items.
Text style accessors.
What about environment issue?
  Compile-time diagnostics
  Accurate argument lists
  Proper set of exported symbols

Fourscore and seven years ago our forefathers
brought forth on this continent a new nation,
conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation, or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
We are met on a great battlefield of that
war.  We have come to dedicate a portion of
that field, as a final resting place for
those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live.  It is altogether fitting
and proper that we do so.  But, in a larger
sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot
consecrate -- we cannot hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
here, have consecrated it far above our poor
power to add or detract.  The world will
little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did
here.  It is for us, the living, rather, to
be dedicated here to the unfinished work
which they who fought here have thus far so
nobly advanced.  It is rather for us to be
here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us -- that from these honored dead we
take increased devotion to that cause for
which they gave the last full measure of
devotion -- that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain --
that this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom -- and that government of
the people, by the people, and for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.
