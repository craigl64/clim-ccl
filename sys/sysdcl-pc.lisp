;;; CLIM is implemented using the "Gray Stream Proposal" (STREAM-DEFINITION-BY-USER)
;;; a proposal to X3J13 in March, 1989 by David Gray of Texas Instruments.  In that
;;; proposal, stream objects are built on certain CLOS classes, and stream functions
;;; (e.g., WRITE-CHAR) are non-generic interfaces to generic functions (e.g.,
;;; STREAM-WRITE-CHAR).  These "trampoline" functions are required because their
;;; STREAM argument is often optional, which means it cannot be used to dispatch to
;;; different methods.

;;; Various Lisp vendors have their own stream implementations, some of which are
;;; identical to the Gray proposal, some of which implement just the trampoline
;;; functions and not the classes, etc.  If the Lisp vendor has not implemented the
;;; classes, we will shadow those class names (and the predicate functions for them)
;;; in the CLIM-LISP package, and define the classes ourselves.  If the vendor has
;;; not implemented the trampoline functions, we will shadow their names, and write
;;; our own trampolines which will call our generic function, and then write default
;;; methods which will invoke the COMMON-LISP package equivalents.
