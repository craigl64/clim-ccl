;;;; Compile CLX

;;; COMPILE-CLX compiles the lisp source files and loads the binaries.
;;; It goes to some trouble to let the source files be in one directory
;;; and the binary files in another.  Thus the same set of sources can
;;; be used for different machines and/or lisp systems.  It also allows
;;; you to supply explicit extensions, so source files do not have to
;;; be renamed to fit into the naming conventions of an implementation.

;;; For example,
;;;     (compile-clx "*.lisp" "machine/")
;;; compiles source files from the connected directory and puts them
;;; into the "machine" subdirectory.  You can then load CLX out of the
;;; machine directory.

;;; The code has no knowledge of the source file types (eg, ".l" or
;;; ".lisp") or of the binary file types (eg, ".b" or ".sbin").  Calling
;;; compile-file and load with a file type of NIL usually sorts things
;;; out correctly, but you may have to explicitly give the source and
;;; binary file types.

;;; An attempt at compiling the C language sources is also made,
;;; but you may have to set different compiler switches
;;; should be.  If it doesn't do the right thing, then do
;;;     (compile-clx "" "" :compile-c NIL)
;;; to prevent the compilation.

;;;; Load CLX

;;; This procedure loads the binaries for CLX.  All of the binaries
;;; should be in the same directory, so setting the default pathname
;;; should point load to the right place.

;;; You should have a module definition somewhere so the require/provide
;;; mechanism can avoid reloading CLX.  In an ideal world, somebody would
;;; just put
;;;		(REQUIRE 'CLX)
;;; in their file (some implementations don't have a central registry for
;;; modules, so a pathname needs to be supplied).

;;; The REQUIRE should find a file that does
;;;		(IN-PACKAGE 'XLIB :USE '(LISP))
;;;		(PROVIDE 'CLX)
;;;		(LOAD <clx-defsystem-file>)
;;;		(LOAD-CLX <binary-specific-clx-directory>)
